# fake-useragent (fixed) — Issue #446

A small, focused fix for fake-useragent Issue #446 (insufficient randomness when
creating UserAgent instances with restrictive filters). This repository contains
a minimal, well-tested reproduction and a robust fix.

Quick start
-----------

- Install (editable):

  python -m pip install -e .

- Run the demonstration script:

  python fixed_version.py

- Run the tests:

  pytest -v

What was wrong
--------------
When callers constructed a `UserAgent` with filters (browsers / min_version),
some versions of the library returned the same user-agent repeatedly. The
root cause was caching a single chosen UA for a filtered configuration rather
than selecting a UA at each access.

What this project provides
--------------------------
- A clear, small implementation that always selects a new UA on each access.
- A fallback strategy when filters are overly restrictive.
- Comprehensive, non-flaky pytest coverage that verifies the fix.
